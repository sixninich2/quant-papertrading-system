# Design choices

## Why n8n
n8n was used as an orchestration layer to automate repetitive screening tasks
while keeping logic modular and easily adjustable.

## Why these metrics
- ROCE and operating margin capture capital efficiency and operational quality.
- Revenue growth ensures the business is not structurally declining.
- Price-to-cash-flow avoids accounting distortions.
- Low leverage reduces downside risk.
- Momentum acts as a timing filter.

## Why paper trading
The system was intentionally designed as a simulation environment
to validate strategy logic before any real capital deployment.
